# Week 3

## Summary

The following content was covered in week 3 in the lecture and the practical:

-   Corrections -- the pre-processing of the raw remotely sensed data

    -   Geometric

    -   Atmospheric

    -   Orthorectification / Topographic

    -   Radiometric

-   Data joining and enhancement

    -   Feathering

    -   Image enhancement

Here I will focus on atmospheric correction -- it seems that this type of correction is the most common, as most of the results I saw with the Google search of "remote sensing corrections" seemed to deal with atmospheric correction. Below is a mind map of atmospheric correction, based on the lecture materials and the work by Jenks \[\]. It puts together the importance of applying the atmospheric correction, and the different methods which can be employed based on the condition of the image and the capability.
