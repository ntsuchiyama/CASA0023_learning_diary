## Summary

The American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) has defined remote sensing as "the measurement or acquisition of information of some property of an object or phenomenon, by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object or phenomenon under study (Colwell, 1983) . To understand how remote sensing works, it is crucial for one to learn about electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a kind of kinetic energy that is produced with the movement of electrically charged particles through space" (citation). Electromagnetic radiation consists of two components, an electric field and magnetic field, and it moves back and forth in and changes between the fields in a wave-like fashion ().

The waves have differing three main different properties of waves - Wavelength: "the distance energy travels from a moment of maximum electrical energy until reaching the maximum again" - Amplitude: "the peak value of the wave" - Frequency: "the number of cycles of the wave that occur in one second". The product of the wavelength and frequency is constant, equalling to the speed of light (ibid.). Electromagnetic spectrum refers to the range of wavelength and frequencies that produces different colours of visible light and non-visible light ().

In remote sensing, data may be collected with passive sensors that collect the electromagnetic radiation sourced from the Sun or other objects on the Earth and then reflected or emitted. It could also be collected using active sensors, such as RADAR and LiDAR, which produce the electromagnetic radiation and detects the reflection (). There are a number of dimensions of the data to be considered in this collection process. One of these dimensions is regarding the spectral information and resolution. It is common for sources of remote sensing data to produce multi-band images, which means that the images are composed of multiple bands each comprised of a range of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum (). The relationship between the amount of electromagnetic radiation reflected in each of the bands and the biological, chemical, and physical attributes are often modelled (). Bands are selected based on their appropriateness for the getting information about these attributes, regarding the maximisation of the background and variable of interest. Other dimensions to be considered are the
