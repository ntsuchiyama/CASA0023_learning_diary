In recent years, a suite of adaptation measures has been developed to mitigate the damage caused by the urban heat island phenomena. This book “Adaptation Measures for Urban Heat Islands” helps the reader understand the relative performance of these adaptation measures, methods and analysis relating to their creation and maintenance, evaluation methods, and the role of policy and governance in implementing them. A suite of case studies ranges widely through the urban heat island literatures. In this book, the three activities authors have been working on in Osaka Heat Island Countermeasure Technology Consortium are organized; organization of adaptation measures, examination of specific image of adaptive city, and examination of evaluation method of adaptive city.},
