    "text": "2.1 Summary\nYokohama City, located approximately 30-40km away to the south west from the central area of Tokyo, is the capital city of Kanagawa prefecture. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, it is the largest municipality in the country. Yokohama as a port city is known for its leading role in trade, commerce, shipping, shipbuilding internationally, supporting the everyday lives of the Tokyo Metropolitan region (The City of Yokohama Europe Representative Office, n.d.).\nForming the Tokyo-Yokohama conurbation, Yokohama city has been identified as urban areas with one of the highest risks of natural disasters due to its high exposure to earthquakes and flood risks (Schwarz, Michael 2014). Based on these identified risks, the Disaster Risk Prevention Plan set by Yokohama has three pillars: measures against earthquakes, measure against floods and storms, and measures against urban disasters (Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Council 2021a). Here, we would like to focus on measures against earthquakes, due to its proneness to different types of earthquakes and the large scale damage expected (City of Yokohama 2019).\nThe existing plan is focused on the actions to be taken for an immediate response (comprised of 177 pages), while there has not been as much attention towards the rehabilitation and recovery of the city (comprised of 30 pages). Within this framework, the reconstruction of the city has been minimum amount of attention, briefly mentioning its plans to consider the areas for specific policy implementation, notify the residents, considering the plans for Yokohoma city as a whole and each area (Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Council 2021b). In the action strategy based on this plan set for 2013-2022 comprised of three main goals: minimising damage, suppress confusion in the event of an outbreak and protect the lives of citizens, and support victims and promote early recovery, there was no direct mention of City Reconstruction as a target (The City of Yokohama 2013).\nIn the neighbouring city Tokyo, there have been efforts made for “Pre-reconstruction”, which involves considering in advance the modalities, procedures, and execution system for a rapid and well-planned urban reconstruction and sharing the information with residents and administrative staff (Bureau of Urban Development Tokyo Metropolitan Government 2021). This indicates the importance of having a more well-developed plan for recovery. In addition, in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phase has been identified as a ‘critical opportunity to build back better’ (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, n.d.). It also recognises the phase as allowing further disaster risk reduction to be incorporated in the development measures (ibid.). Therefore, it is crucial for Yokohama city to implement policies that allow for an effective recovery which will make the city more prepared for future disaster not just only earthquakes."

    "text": "2.2 Applications\nRemote sensing data has been used as a proxy of disaster risk in different phases, such as damage, recovery, resilience, and vulnerability (Ghaffarian, Kerle, and Filatova 2018a). Here, we are especially interested in how the data may be used in recovery process. In addition, there are several types of environments where remote-sensing based proxies have been developed (ibid.). This includes physical assessments through investigating built-up aspects, and also non-physical assessments involving economic, social, and natural aspects (ibid.).\nOne of the potential applications of remote sensing applications is by looking at building removal and reconstruction through very high resolution (VHR) images over multiple time periods. The number of reconstructed buildings can show how much progress has been made in the recovery process (Ghaffarian, Kerle, and Filatova 2018b). A periodic monitoring of recovery is important to understand the locations where recovery is slow, which will allow for further examination into the reasons for the the delay and implementing targeted measures that tackle the issue. However, it should be noted that while this data may be used for understanding the speed of recovery, investigation into the quality of recovery should be conducted as well, perhaps through field observations (Platt, Brown, and Hughes 2016). This will allow for the assessment of functional recovery.\nAnother potential area of application is looking into spatial connectivity to the central business district, in this case not only the CBD of Yokohama but also Tokyo as it is often considered as a singular urban zone. This involves the usage of satellite imagery for the identification of road networks. According to the study by Contreas et al (2013), spatial connectivity which is measured by variables such as distance and travel time may be considered as a proxy for post-earthquake recovery due to its relationship with the return of economic functioning."

    "text": "2.3 Reflections\nResearching into the application of remote sensing data in the field of disaster risk reduction was very informative in terms of what areas have been less researched, which also happen to be perhaps payed less attention in policy. According to Ghaffarian et al (2018c), the theme of recovery has been relatively neglected in the area of disaster risk reduction in comparison to areas of damage and vulnerability. In addition, much of the research with remote sensing data particulary through the usage of small aerial drones, a newer platform for satellite imagery have been applied to landslides or other mass movements, particularly within rural environments (Kucharczyk and Hugenholtz 2021). Research around earthquakes and disasters in urban areas in general has been less researched (ibid.). Yokohama pushing forward policies for the usage of remote sensing data for the recovery and reconstruction of the city may become a role model for other cities to follow, and allow for more research in the area.\n\n\n\n\nBureau of Urban Development Tokyo Metropolitan Government. 2021. “Efforts for Pre-Recovery of the City in Preparation for an Earthquake Directly Hitting the Tokyo Metropolitan Area (首都直下地震等に備えた都市の事前復興の取組).” https://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/bunyabetsu/bosai/shuto.html.\n\n\nCity of Yokohama. 2019. “Estimated Damage in Yokohama City (横浜市の被害想定).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/wagaya/jishin/higai/higaisoutei.html.\n\n\nContreras, Diana, Thomas Blaschke, Stefan Kienberger, and Peter Zeil. 2013. “Spatial Connectivity as a Recovery Process Indicator: The l’aquila Earthquake.” Technological Forecasting and Social Change 80 (9): 17821803.\n\n\nGhaffarian, Saman, Norman Kerle, and Tatiana Filatova. 2018a. “Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk Management and Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10 (11): 1760.\n\n\n———. 2018b. “Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk Management and Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10 (11): 1760.\n\n\n———. 2018c. “Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk Management and Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10 (11): 1760.\n\n\nKucharczyk, Maja, and Chris H Hugenholtz. 2021. “Remote Sensing of Natural Hazard-Related Disasters with Small Drones: Global Trends, Biases, and Research Opportunities.” Remote Sensing of Environment 264: 112577.\n\n\nPlatt, Stephen, Daniel Brown, and Martin Hughes. 2016. “Measuring Resilience and Recovery.” International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 19: 447460.\n\n\nSchwarz, Michael. 2014. “Risky Cities: Tokyo.” Zurich. https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:22462410-f30f-46a3-9bc0-4713c5760928/Factsheet_Tokyo-Yokohama_WEB.pdf.\n\n\nThe City of Yokohama. 2013. “Yokohama City Earthquake Disaster Prevention Strategy (横浜市地震防災戦略).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/bosaikeikaku/keikaku/keikakutou/shinsai.files/jisinbousaisenryaku.pdf.\n\n\nThe City of Yokohama Europe Representative Office. n.d. “The Reasons Why Yokohama Is Chosen (横浜が選ばれる理由).” https://yokohama-city.de/jp/business-opportunities/.\n\n\nUnited Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. n.d. “What Is the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction?” https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework.\n\n\nYokohama City Disaster Prevention Council. 2021b. “Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Plan Earthquake Countermeasures 2021 (横浜市防災計画震災対策編).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/bosaikeikaku/keikaku/keikakutou/shinsai.files/shinsaitaisaku-all.pdf.\n\n\n———. 2021a. “Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Plan Earthquake Countermeasures 2021 (横浜市防災計画震災対策編).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/bosaikeikaku/keikaku/keikakutou/shinsai.files/shinsaitaisaku-all.pdf."
