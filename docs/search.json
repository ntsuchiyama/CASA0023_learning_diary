    "text": "Introduction\n\nHello! My name is Nanami Tsuchiyama, I’m an MSc Urban Spatial Science student at UCL CASA. I was born and brought up in Tokyo, Japan for most of my life. This is my fifth year in London.\nI studied Geography and Social Data Science for my undergraduate degree at the Department of Geography at UCL, where I developed interests in urban geography and quantitative analysis. In my second year of undergraduate studies, I took the module “Understanding Cities and their Spatial Cultures”, which was run by academics at CASA. I was introduced to the different areas of research conducted at the department which I found very interesting and it motivated me to study this degree.\nI decided to take this module (CASA0023) because I was interested in how remote sensing may be used to collect data on informal settlements in the Global South, where traditional forms of data is scarce. For my dissertation in my undergraduate degree I wrote about Food Deserts in Johannesburg, South Africa, where I faced challenges collecting data around informal areas and economy. These limitations led me to literature about analysis of socio-economic conditions based on satellite images. Through this module I hope to learn how remote sensing works, and develop a better understanding of how these type of analysis is conducted."

    "text": "Summary\nYokohama City, located approximately 30-40km away to the south west from the central area of Tokyo, is the capital city of Kanagawa prefecture. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, it is the largest municipality in the country. Yokohama as a port city is known for its leading role in trade, commerce, shipping, shipbuilding internationally, supporting the everyday lives of the Tokyo Metropolitan region (The City of Yokohama Europe Representative Office n.d.).\nForming the Tokyo-Yokohama conurbation, Yokohama city has been identified as urban areas with one of the highest risks of natural disasters due to its high exposure to earthquakes and flood risks (Schwarz, Michael 2014). Based on these identified risks, the Disaster Risk Prevention Plan set by Yokohama has three pillars: measures against earthquakes, measure against floods and storms, and measures against urban disasters (Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Council 2021). Here, we would like to focus on measures against earthquakes, due to its proneness to different types of earthquakes and the large scale damage expected (The City of Yokohama 2019).\nThe existing plan is focused on the actions to be taken for an immediate response (comprised of 177 pages), while there has not been as much attention towards the rehabilitation and recovery of the city (comprised of 30 pages). Within this framework, the reconstruction of the city has been minimum amount of attention, briefly mentioning its plans to consider the areas for specific policy implementation, notify the residents, considering the plans for Yokohoma city as a whole and each area (Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Council 2021). In the action strategy based on this plan set for 2013-2022 comprised of three main goals: minimising damage, suppress confusion in the event of an outbreak and protect the lives of citizens, and support victims and promote early recovery, there was no direct mention of City Reconstruction as a target (The City of Yokohama 2013).\nIn the neighbouring city Tokyo, there have been efforts made for “Pre-reconstruction”, which involves considering in advance the modalities, procedures, and execution system for a rapid and well-planned urban reconstruction and sharing the information with residents and administrative staff (Bureau of Urban Development Tokyo Metropolitan Government 2021). This indicates the importance of having a more well-developed plan for recovery. In addition, in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phase has been identified as a ‘critical opportunity to build back better’ (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction n.d.). It also recognises the phase as allowing further disaster risk reduction to be incorporated in the development measures (ibid.). Therefore, it is crucial for Yokohama city to implement policies that allow for an effective recovery which will make the city more prepared for future disaster not just only earthquakes."

    "text": "Applications\nRemote sensing data has been used as a proxy of disaster risk in different phases, such as damage, recovery, resilience, and vulnerability (Ghaffarian, Kerle, and Filatova 2018). Here, we are especially interested in how the data may be used in recovery process. In addition, there are several types of environments where remote-sensing based proxies have been developed (ibid.). This includes physical assessments through investigating built-up aspects, and also non-physical assessments involving economic, social, and natural aspects (ibid.).\nOne of the potential applications of remote sensing applications is by looking at building removal and reconstruction through very high resolution (VHR) images over multiple time periods. The number of reconstructed buildings can show how much progress has been made in the recovery process (Ghaffarian, Kerle, and Filatova 2018). A periodic monitoring of recovery is important to understand the locations where recovery is slow, which will allow for further examination into the reasons for the the delay and implementing targeted measures that tackle the issue. However, it should be noted that while this data may be used for understanding the speed of recovery, investigation into the quality of recovery should be conducted as well, perhaps through field observations (Platt, Brown, and Hughes 2016). This will allow for the assessment of functional recovery.\nAnother potential area of application is looking into spatial connectivity to the central business district, in this case not only the CBD of Yokohama but also Tokyo as it is often considered as a singular urban zone. This involves the usage of satellite imagery for the identification of road networks. According to the study by Contreas et al (2013), spatial connectivity which is measured by variables such as distance and travel time may be considered as a proxy for post-earthquake recovery due to its relationship with the return of economic functioning."

    "text": "Reflections\nResearching into the application of remote sensing data in the field of disaster risk reduction was very informative in terms of what areas have been less researched, which also happen to be perhaps payed less attention in policy. According to Ghaffarian et al (2018), the theme of recovery has been relatively neglected in the area of disaster risk reduction in comparison to areas of damage and vulnerability. In addition, much of the research with remote sensing data particulary through the usage of small aerial drones, a newer platform for satellite imagery have been applied to landslides or other mass movements, particularly within rural environments (Kucharczyk and Hugenholtz 2021). Research around earthquakes and disasters in urban areas in general has been less researched (ibid.). Yokohama pushing forward policies for the usage of remote sensing data for the recovery and reconstruction of the city may become a role model for other cities to follow, and allow for more research in the area.\n\n\n\n\nBureau of Urban Development Tokyo Metropolitan Government. 2021. “Efforts for Pre-Recovery of the City in Preparation for an Earthquake Directly Hitting the Tokyo Metropolitan Area (首都直下地震等に備えた都市の事前復興の取組).” Bureau of Urban Development Tokyo Metropolitan Government. https://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/bunyabetsu/bosai/shuto.html.\n\n\nContreras, Diana, Thomas Blaschke, Stefan Kienberger, and Peter Zeil. 2013. “Spatial Connectivity as a Recovery Process Indicator: The L’Aquila Earthquake.” Technological Forecasting and Social Change 80 (9): 1782–1803.\n\n\nGhaffarian, Saman, Norman Kerle, and Tatiana Filatova. 2018. “Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk Management and Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10 (11): 1760.\n\n\nKucharczyk, Maja, and Chris H Hugenholtz. 2021. “Remote Sensing of Natural Hazard-Related Disasters with Small Drones: Global Trends, Biases, and Research Opportunities.” Remote Sensing of Environment 264: 112577.\n\n\nPlatt, Stephen, Daniel Brown, and Martin Hughes. 2016. “Measuring Resilience and Recovery.” International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 19: 447–60.\n\n\nSchwarz, Michael. 2014. “Risky Cities: Tokyo.” Zurich: Swiss Re. https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:22462410-f30f-46a3-9bc0-4713c5760928/Factsheet_Tokyo-Yokohama_WEB.pdf.\n\n\nThe City of Yokohama. 2013. “Yokohama City Earthquake Disaster Prevention Strategy (横浜市地震防災戦略).” The City of Yokohama. https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/bosaikeikaku/keikaku/keikakutou/shinsai.files/jisinbousaisenryaku.pdf.\n\n\n———. 2019. “Estimated Damage in Yokohama City (横浜市の被害想定).” The City of Yokohama. https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/wagaya/jishin/higai/higaisoutei.html.\n\n\nThe City of Yokohama Europe Representative Office. n.d. “The Reasons Why Yokohama Is Chosen (横浜が選ばれる理由).” The City of Yokohama Europe Representative Office.

    "text": "The American Society for Photogrametry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) has defined remote sensing as “the measurement or acquisition of information of some property of an object or phenomenon, by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object or phenomenon under study (Colwell, 1983) . To understand how remote sensing works, it is crucial for one to learn about electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a kind of kinetic energy that is produced with the movement of electrically charged particles through space” (citation). Electromagnetic radiation consists of two components, an electric field and magnetic field, and it moves back and forth in and changes between the fields in a wave-like fashion ().\nThe waves have differing three main different properties of waves - Wavelength: “the distance energy travels from a moment of maximum electrical energy until reaching the maximum again” - Amplitude: “the peak value of the wave” - Frequency: “the number of cycles of the wave that occur in one second”. The product of the wavelength and frequency is constant, equalling to the speed of light (ibid.). Electromagnetic spectrum refers to the range of wavelength and frequencies that produces different colours of visible light and non-visible light ().\nIn remote sensing, data may be collected with passive sensors that collect the electromagnetic radiation sourced from the Sun or other objects on the Earth and then reflected or emitted. It could also be collected using active sensors, such as RADAR and LiDAR, which produce the electromagnetic radiation and detects the reflection (). There are a number of dimensions of the data to be considered in this collection process. One of these dimensions is regarding the spectral information and resolution. It is common for sources of remote sensing data to produce multi-band images, which means that the images are composed of multiple bands each comprised of a range of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum (). The relationship between the amount of electromagnetic radiation reflected in each of the bands and the biological, chemical, and physical attributes are often modelled (). Bands are selected based on their appropriateness for the getting information about these attributes, regarding the maximisation of the background and variable of interest. Other dimensions to be considered are spatial resolution and the temporal resolution. The subject areas where remote sensing data is applied may differ depending on the combination of the values.\nHere I will introduce two studies that I have found. The first study by Oon et al. (2019) is about the classification of given the issue of the conversion of tropical swamp forests into oil palm agriculture land, and how remote sensing data may be use for the identification of these areas, including whether they are large scale plantations operated by commercial firms, or smaller farms run by individual farmers. The region of interest is the state of Selangor on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, and level 2 imagery from Landsat-8 for the four dates of 24 March 2014, 30 March 2015, 29 March 2016 and 17 April 2017 was tests. It calculates three types of vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). NDVI and SAVI is calculated with bands 4 (red band) and 5 (near-infrared (NIR) band), and EVI is calculated with bands 3 (blue band), 4 and 5. These indices are used to classify land usage for three categories with different methods: the supervised maximum likelihood (ML), random tree (RT) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The second study by Yang and Du (2017) is regarding the extraction of water bodies for the monitoring of water resources by devising an enhanced water index. The development of EHI is based on three measures. This includes the first two components of principle components analysis conducted on the six multispectral bands in 30m pixel size from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery for 23 September 2011. The third measure is the modified Normalized difference water index (NDWI) which is calculated with TM Band 2 which corresponds to the green band, and TM Band 5 which corresponds to the mid-infrared band (MIR). The accuracy of EHI is tested in comparison to other indices, with the results demonstrating the appropriateness of EHI for extracting water bodies in areas of mixed land usage. The two studies demonstrate how studies do not only consider the direct usage of the remote sensing data from different bands at various combinations of spatial and temporal resolutions but how the different bands are combined together for the calculation of indices to develop or classification for an enhanced understanding.\nLearning about how remote sensing works It was interesting how the values of different bands are combined develop different types of indices and how these are developed on the base of the top."

Learning about spatial autocorrelation made me aware of the importance of having a critical eye on results I see in papers, on whether their approach has considered the issue of spatial autocorrelation when splitting the data into the testing data and training data. However, it was interesting to find scholars that spatial cross validation is not effective. I think this addresses the importance of considering different approaches and developing a better understanding of what the approach does well in and what may be the limitation in employing the specific method."

    "text": "7.1 Summary\nThis week in the lecture, we went through two mainly two topics:\n\nTemperature and Policy\nExtraction of Temperature from Satellite Data\n\nIn the practical, in terms of the Google Earth Engine, we went through how data from Landsat and MODIS may be used for the extraction of temperature.\nTo start off, I will provide a summary of the content through a Q&A format of questions to be considered for the topic of Urban Heat Island, which we covered in the lecture and is an \"an important environmental problem facing all large urban centers\".\nWhat is the Urban Heat Island?\n-       The Urban Heat Island refers to the phenomena where an urban or metropolitan area has a significantly higher temperature compared to the surrounding rural areas due to human activities ()\nHow does it occur?\n-       The following diagram demonstrates how the Urban Heat Island is caused, showing how there are many factors involved in the process of the generation of this effect. The main two sources of Urban Heat Island can be attributed to the heat generated from urban structures from their consumption and re-radiation of solar radiation (\"Urban design and structure related\" in the diagram) and anthropogenic heat from sources such as power plants, automobiles, air-conditioners [].\nWhat are the impacts of Urban Heat Island?\n-       Urban heat island can affect the environment and quality of life an area in different ways\nØ  Increase in energy consumption – overall electricity demand and peak energy demand\nØ  Increase in emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gas\nØ  Heat-related deaths and illnesses especially among vulnerable groups of people ()\nWhat are there any policies addressing this issue?\nRemote sensing may be used to address the issue from both the problem side in terms of how the urban heat island effect intensifies with land cover change and the solution side in terms of the effectiveness of the possible policy interventions. Here I will introduce two studies, both based in Phoenix, Arizona, which each consider the urban heat island problem with the two perspectives respectively.\nThe study by Wang et al studies how the urban heat island effect has expanded spatially across time and its relationship with land usage and land cover (LULC) in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. For the temperature data, it uses land surface temperature data from MODIS, specifically 8-day composite June imagery due to ideal weather conditions. One limitation of the usage of MODIS is the low spatial resolution (1000m). However, it is argued that the generation for a relatively large sample size may account for this limitation. A total of 58 images are collected. For the classified LULC map, Landsat Data for 2000 (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper Image) and 2014 (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager) are used, based on 30m spatial resolution. The data is classified into a total of 6 classes (water, impervious surface, vegetation, urban/residential area, open soil and fallow cropland) using the Iterative Self-Organising Data Analysis unsupervised classification algorithm. The accuracy assessment is based on a minimum of 50 sample points for each class produced from a stratified random sampling approach, and is conducted using Google Earth and local observations.\nThe study conducted by\nReflection\nIt is interesting to learn how the"

(2017). According to Google Scholar, this article has been cited in 6963 pieces of academic work, which I think demonstrates the strong influence of GEE in the field of Remote Sensing in terms of the changing the workflow.\nFor the application of GEE, I will introduce the review article by Liu et al. (2018), which introduces the Flood Prevention and Emergency and Response System (FPERS) in Taiwan. It is a paper that presents how the usage of Google Earth Engine may be beneficial for policies. The attached figure is a flow chart of how the FPERS supports decision making in the pre-flood, during-flood and post-flood stage.\nThe merits of using GEE for this FPERS maybe outlined as below (Liu et al. 2018):\n\nThe ability to prepare and update images for analysis for analysis and visualisation\n\nCost effective for accessing up to date data (Sentinel-2 data for every five days)\n\nIncorporation of the global topological data, allowing for 3D display of the data\n\nHowever, it is quite important that they also consider the limitations in GEE for the usage of this system.

(2018) state that the GEE lacks the flexibility for managing and searching an expansive database with its increasing number of data, requiring the knowledge of the data the user wants to use and selecting the data based on conditions. Moreover, due to the depreciation of Google Earth API, the services were downgraded to Google Maps API, only allowing for 2D Display. This highlights the challenges which may arise when relying on a single commercial platform.\nThe have the amount of attention given to Google Earth Engine and its applications in different areas has been interesting. In terms of the technicality, I think the computational easiness which has been addressed throughout the lecture and in the works of Gorelick of Google Earth Engine is a great advantage, after using RStudio for some of the analysis in previous weeks. The range of things that is made possible with GEE in FPERS is quite astonishing. However, obviously GEE is not perfect for every single application, so I think it is important to develop an understanding what can be done well and what cannot. Moreover, in terms of accessibility, the paper on FPERS by Liu et al. was informing about the limitations of GEE and how it is not perhaps being accessible for everyone as I thought and how it promotes it is. The point regarding the reliance on a single platform was quite interesting, and I would like to perhaps explore alternative platforms for analysis in the future.\n\n\n\n\nGorelick, Noel, Matt Hancher, Mike Dixon, Simon Ilyushchenko, David Thau, and Rebecca Moore. 2017. “Google Earth Engine: Planetary-Scale Geospatial Analysis for Everyone.” Remote Sensing of Environment 202: 18–27.\n\n\nLiu, Cheng-Chien, Ming-Chang Shieh, Ming-Syun Ke, and Kung-Hwa Wang. 2018. “Flood Prevention and Emergency Response System Powered by Google Earth Engine.” Remote Sensing 10 (8): 1283."

The main two sources of Urban Heat Island can be attributed to the heat generated from urban structures from their consumption and re-radiation of solar radiation (\"Urban design and structure related\" in the diagram) and anthropogenic heat from sources such as power plants, automobiles, air-conditioners [].\nWhat are the impacts of Urban Heat Island?\n-       Urban heat island can affect the environment and quality of life an area in different ways\nØ  Increase in energy consumption – overall electricity demand and peak energy demand\nØ  Increase in emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gas\nØ  Heat-related deaths and illnesses especially among vulnerable groups of people ()\nWhat are there any policies addressing this issue?\nRemote sensing may be used to address the issue from both the problem side in terms of how the urban heat island effect intensifies with land cover change and the solution side in terms of the effectiveness of the possible policy interventions. Here I will introduce two studies, both based in Phoenix, Arizona, which each consider the urban heat island problem with the two perspectives respectively.\nThe study by Wang et al studies how the urban heat island effect has expanded spatially across time and its relationship with land usage and land cover (LULC) in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. For the temperature data, it uses land surface temperature data from MODIS, specifically 8-day composite June imagery due to ideal weather conditions. One limitation of the usage of MODIS is the low spatial resolution (1000m). However, it is argued that the generation for a relatively large sample size may account for this limitation. A total of 58 images are collected. For the classified LULC map, Landsat Data for 2000 (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper Image) and 2014 (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager) are used, based on 30m spatial resolution. The data is classified into a total of 6 classes (water, impervious surface, vegetation, urban/residential area, open soil and fallow cropland) using the Iterative Self-Organising Data Analysis unsupervised classification algorithm. The accuracy assessment is based on a minimum of 50 sample points for each class produced from a stratified random sampling approach, and is conducted using Google Earth and local observations.\nThe study conducted by\nReflection\nIt is interesting to learn how the"
