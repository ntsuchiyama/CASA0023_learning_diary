    "text": "Introduction\n\nHello! My name is Nanami Tsuchiyama, I’m an MSc Urban Spatial Science student at UCL CASA. I was born and brought up in Tokyo, Japan for most of my life. This is my fifth year in London.\nI studied Geography and Social Data Science for my undergraduate degree at the Department of Geography at UCL, where I developed interests in urban geography and quantitative analysis. In my second year of undergraduate studies, I took the module “Understanding Cities and their Spatial Cultures”, which was run by academics at CASA. I was introduced to the different areas of research conducted at the department which I found very interesting and it motivated me to study this degree.\nI decided to take this module (CASA0023) because I was interested in how remote sensing may be used to collect data on informal settlements in the Global South, where traditional forms of data is scarce. For my dissertation in my undergraduate degree I wrote about Food Deserts in Johannesburg, South Africa, where I faced challenges collecting data around informal areas and economy. These limitations led me to literature about analysis of socio-economic conditions based on satellite images. Through this module I hope to learn how remote sensing works, and develop a better understanding of how these type of analysis is conducted."

    "text": "4.1 Summary\nYokohama City, located approximately 30-40km away to the south west from the central area of Tokyo, is the capital city of Kanagawa prefecture. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, it is the largest municipality in the country. Yokohama as a port city is known for its leading role in trade, commerce, shipping, shipbuilding internationally, supporting the everyday lives of the Tokyo Metropolitan region (The City of Yokohama Europe Representative Office, n.d.).\nForming the Tokyo-Yokohama conurbation, Yokohama city has been identified as urban areas with one of the highest risks of natural disasters due to its high exposure to earthquakes and flood risks (Schwarz, Michael 2014). Based on these identified risks, the Disaster Risk Prevention Plan set by Yokohama has three pillars: measures against earthquakes, measure against floods and storms, and measures against urban disasters (Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Council 2021a). Here, we would like to focus on measures against earthquakes, due to its proneness to different types of earthquakes and the large scale damage expected (City of Yokohama 2019).\nThe existing plan is focused on the actions to be taken for an immediate response (comprised of 177 pages), while there has not been as much attention towards the rehabilitation and recovery of the city (comprised of 30 pages). Within this framework, the reconstruction of the city has been minimum amount of attention, briefly mentioning its plans to consider the areas for specific policy implementation, notify the residents, considering the plans for Yokohoma city as a whole and each area (Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Council 2021b). In the action strategy based on this plan set for 2013-2022 comprised of three main goals: minimising damage, suppress confusion in the event of an outbreak and protect the lives of citizens, and support victims and promote early recovery, there was no direct mention of City Reconstruction as a target (The City of Yokohama 2013).\nIn the neighbouring city Tokyo, there have been efforts made for “Pre-reconstruction”, which involves considering in advance the modalities, procedures, and execution system for a rapid and well-planned urban reconstruction and sharing the information with residents and administrative staff (Bureau of Urban Development Tokyo Metropolitan Government 2021). This indicates the importance of having a more well-developed plan for recovery. In addition, in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phase has been identified as a ‘critical opportunity to build back better’ (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, n.d.). It also recognises the phase as allowing further disaster risk reduction to be incorporated in the development measures (ibid.). Therefore, it is crucial for Yokohama city to implement policies that allow for an effective recovery which will make the city more prepared for future disaster not just only earthquakes."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nRemote sensing data has been used as a proxy of disaster risk in different phases, such as damage, recovery, resilience, and vulnerability (Ghaffarian, Kerle, and Filatova 2018a). Here, we are especially interested in how the data may be used in recovery process. In addition, there are several types of environments where remote-sensing based proxies have been developed (ibid.). This includes physical assessments through investigating built-up aspects, and also non-physical assessments involving economic, social, and natural aspects (ibid.).\nOne of the potential applications of remote sensing applications is by looking at building removal and reconstruction through very high resolution (VHR) images over multiple time periods. The number of reconstructed buildings can show how much progress has been made in the recovery process (Ghaffarian, Kerle, and Filatova 2018b). A periodic monitoring of recovery is important to understand the locations where recovery is slow, which will allow for further examination into the reasons for the the delay and implementing targeted measures that tackle the issue. However, it should be noted that while this data may be used for understanding the speed of recovery, investigation into the quality of recovery should be conducted as well, perhaps through field observations (Platt, Brown, and Hughes 2016). This will allow for the assessment of functional recovery.\nAnother potential area of application is looking into spatial connectivity to the central business district, in this case not only the CBD of Yokohama but also Tokyo as it is often considered as a singular urban zone. This involves the usage of satellite imagery for the identification of road networks. According to the study by Contreas et al (2013), spatial connectivity which is measured by variables such as distance and travel time may be considered as a proxy for post-earthquake recovery due to its relationship with the return of economic functioning."

    "text": "4.3 Reflections\nResearching into the application of remote sensing data in the field of disaster risk reduction was very informative in terms of what areas have been less researched, which also happen to be perhaps payed less attention in policy. According to Ghaffarian et al (2018c), the theme of recovery has been relatively neglected in the area of disaster risk reduction in comparison to areas of damage and vulnerability. In addition, much of the research with remote sensing data particulary through the usage of small aerial drones, a newer platform for satellite imagery have been applied to landslides or other mass movements, particularly within rural environments (Kucharczyk and Hugenholtz 2021). Research around earthquakes and disasters in urban areas in general has been less researched (ibid.). Yokohama pushing forward policies for the usage of remote sensing data for the recovery and reconstruction of the city may become a role model for other cities to follow, and allow for more research in the area.\n\n\nBureau of Urban Development Tokyo Metropolitan Government. 2021.\n“Efforts for Pre-Recovery of the City in Preparation for an\nEarthquake Directly Hitting the Tokyo Metropolitan Area\n(首都直下地震等に備えた都市の事前復興の取組).” https://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/bunyabetsu/bosai/shuto.html.\n\n\nCity of Yokohama. 2019. “Estimated Damage in Yokohama City\n(横浜市の被害想定).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/wagaya/jishin/higai/higaisoutei.html.\n\n\nContreras, Diana, Thomas Blaschke, Stefan Kienberger, and Peter Zeil.\n2013. “Spatial Connectivity as a Recovery Process Indicator: The\nl’aquila Earthquake.” Technological Forecasting and Social\nChange 80 (9): 17821803.\n\n\nGhaffarian, Saman, Norman Kerle, and Tatiana Filatova. 2018a.\n“Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk Management\nand Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10 (11): 1760.\n\n\n———. 2018b. “Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk\nManagement and Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10\n(11): 1760.\n\n\n———. 2018c. “Remote Sensing-Based Proxies for Urban Disaster Risk\nManagement and Resilience: A Review.” Remote Sensing 10\n(11): 1760.\n\n\nKucharczyk, Maja, and Chris H Hugenholtz. 2021. “Remote Sensing of\nNatural Hazard-Related Disasters with Small Drones: Global Trends,\nBiases, and Research Opportunities.” Remote Sensing of\nEnvironment 264: 112577.\n\n\nPlatt, Stephen, Daniel Brown, and Martin Hughes. 2016. “Measuring\nResilience and Recovery.” International Journal of Disaster\nRisk Reduction 19: 447460.\n\n\nSchwarz, Michael. 2014. “Risky Cities: Tokyo.” Zurich. https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:22462410-f30f-46a3-9bc0-4713c5760928/Factsheet_Tokyo-Yokohama_WEB.pdf.\n\n\nThe City of Yokohama. 2013. “Yokohama City Earthquake Disaster\nPrevention Strategy (横浜市地震防災戦略).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/bosaikeikaku/keikaku/keikakutou/shinsai.files/jisinbousaisenryaku.pdf.\n\n\nThe City of Yokohama Europe Representative Office. n.d. “The\nReasons Why Yokohama Is Chosen (横浜が選ばれる理由).” https://yokohama-city.de/jp/business-opportunities/.\n\n\nUnited Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. n.d. “What Is\nthe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction?” https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework.\n\n\nYokohama City Disaster Prevention Council. 2021a. “Yokohama City\nDisaster Prevention Plan Earthquake Countermeasures 2021\n(横浜市防災計画震災対策編).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/bosaikeikaku/keikaku/keikakutou/shinsai.files/shinsaitaisaku-all.pdf.\n\n\n———. 2021b. “Yokohama City Disaster Prevention Plan Earthquake\nCountermeasures 2021 (横浜市防災計画震災対策編).” https://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/kurashi/bousai-kyukyu-bohan/bousai-saigai/bosaikeikaku/keikaku/keikakutou/shinsai.files/shinsaitaisaku-all.pdf."

    "text": "The American Society for Photogrametry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) has defined remote sensing as “the measurement or acquisition of information of some property of an object or phenomenon, by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object or phenomenon under study (Colwell, 1983) . To understand how remote sensing works, it is crucial for one to learn about electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a kind of kinetic energy that is produced with the movement of electrically charged particles through space” (citation). Electromagnetic radiation consists of two components, an electric field and magnetic field, and it moves back and forth in and changes between the fields in a wave-like fashion ().\nThe waves have differing three main different properties of waves - Wavelength: “the distance energy travels from a moment of maximum electrical energy until reaching the maximum again” - Amplitude: “the peak value of the wave” - Frequency: “the number of cycles of the wave that occur in one second”. The product of the wavelength and frequency is constant, equalling to the speed of light (ibid.). Electromagnetic spectrum refers to the range of wavelength and frequencies that produces different colours of visible light and non-visible light ().\nIn remote sensing, data may be collected with passive sensors that collect the electromagnetic radiation sourced from the Sun or other objects on the Earth and then reflected or emitted. It could also be collected using active sensors, such as RADAR and LiDAR, which produce the electromagnetic radiation and detects the reflection (). There are a number of dimensions of the data to be considered in this collection process. One of these dimensions is regarding the spectral information and resolution. It is common for sources of remote sensing data to produce multi-band images, which means that the images are composed of multiple bands each comprised of a range of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum (). The relationship between the amount of electromagnetic radiation reflected in each of the bands and the biological, chemical, and physical attributes are often modelled (). Bands are selected based on their appropriateness for the getting information about these attributes, regarding the maximisation of the background and variable of interest. Other dimensions to be considered are spatial resolution and the temporal resolution. The subject areas where remote sensing data is applied may differ depending on the combination of the values.\nHere I will introduce two studies that I have found. The first study by Oon et al. (2019) is about the classification of given the issue of the conversion of tropical swamp forests into oil palm agriculture land, and how remote sensing data may be use for the identification of these areas, including whether they are large scale plantations operated by commercial firms, or smaller farms run by individual farmers. The region of interest is the state of Selangor on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, and level 2 imagery from Landsat-8 for the four dates of 24 March 2014, 30 March 2015, 29 March 2016 and 17 April 2017 was tests. It calculates three types of vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). NDVI and SAVI is calculated with bands 4 (red band) and 5 (near-infrared (NIR) band), and EVI is calculated with bands 3 (blue band), 4 and 5. These indices are used to classify land usage for three categories with different methods: the supervised maximum likelihood (ML), random tree (RT) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The second study by Yang and Du (2017) is regarding the extraction of water bodies for the monitoring of water resources by devising an enhanced water index. The development of EHI is based on three measures. This includes the first two components of principle components analysis conducted on the six multispectral bands in 30m pixel size from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery for 23 September 2011. The third measure is the modified Normalized difference water index (NDWI) which is calculated with TM Band 2 which corresponds to the green band, and TM Band 5 which corresponds to the mid-infrared band (MIR). The accuracy of EHI is tested in comparison to other indices, with the results demonstrating the appropriateness of EHI for extracting water bodies in areas of mixed land usage. The two studies demonstrate how studies do not only consider the direct usage of the remote sensing data from different bands at various combinations of spatial and temporal resolutions but how the different bands are combined together for the calculation of indices to develop or classification for an enhanced understanding.\nLearning about how remote sensing works It was interesting how the values of different bands are combined develop different types of indices and how these are developed on the base of the top."
